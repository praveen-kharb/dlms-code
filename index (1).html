Dear students, contemplating to current situation, University has taken an initiative to provide our students with study material online, hopefully it will be beneficial for our students and will match to the nowadays digital learning and advancements. The platform will enable teachers and students to continue their teaching-learning process and to interact with each other in cases when physical classes are not possible.

In this digital era, all teachers will help out to complete the curriculum as prescribed by AICTE by adopting digital modes of teaching so as to avoid any loss of study.

As of now, as COVID-19 is prevailing, and university is being shutdown in compliance to government orders, I urge  all teachers and students to cooperate, stay at home and take care of yourself .

               Respected faculty members and dear students, 
Digital India Cell of the University is trying to help its students to consolidate the loss in studies due to shutdown  of university in compliance of the order of Indian government to fight against COVID-19 situation.
I request all teachers to upload study materials for their respective classes at this platform to avoid loss of study to students. Students are advised to take benefits from it and let their syllabii be completed in time. 
I wish this will be helpful for all faculty members and students and I request everyone to cooperate to this initiative by our university. 

Hope you are in good health and taking necessary precautions at your home amid the recent Coronavirus crisis.

Regards
Dr. NEELAM DUHAN
